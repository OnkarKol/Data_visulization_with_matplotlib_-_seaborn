# Data_visulization_with_matplotlib_-_seaborn


# Data Visualization Practice:
This project contains my hands-on practice with Matplotlib and Seaborn, where I visualized different types of data using various charts.

# What’s Covered?
✅ Line Plots – Trends over time (e.g., monthly/annual sales)

✅ Bar Plots – Product-wise or category-wise comparisons

✅ Pie Charts – Market share or percentage-based distribution

✅ Scatter Plots – Relationships between two variables (e.g., sales vs profit)

✅ Box Plots – Distribution of scores across different groups

✅ Violin Plots – Detailed data distribution visualization

✅ Histograms – Frequency distribution of data (e.g., age groups)

✅ Count Plots – Frequency of categorical variables (e.g., gender count)

# Tools Used
1. Matplotlib
2. Seaborn
3. Python (Jupyter Notebook)

# Purpose
* Improve my understanding of data distribution, comparisons, and relationships between variables using charts.
* Build strong foundational skills in data storytelling through visuals.

#This project is part of my learning journey in **Data Science and Visualization**.
